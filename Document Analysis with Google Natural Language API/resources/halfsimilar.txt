                       THE ANT AND THE CRICKET

   Once upon a time... one hot summer, a cricket sang cheerfully on the branch
of a tree, while down below, a long line of ants struggled damely under the
weight of their load of grains; and between one song and the next, the cricket
spoke to the ants. "Why are you working so hard? Come into the shade, away from
the sun, and sing a song with me." But the tireless ants went on with the
work... "We can't do that," they said, "We must store away food for the winter.
When the weather`s cold and the ground white with snow, there's nothing to eat,
and we'll survive the winter only if the pantry is full."
   "There's plenty of summer to come," replied the cricket, "and lots of time
to fill the pantry before winter. I'd rather sing! How can anione work in this
heat and sun?"
   And so all summer, the cricket sang while the ants laboured. But the days
turned into weeks and the weeks into months.
